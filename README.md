# Electroporation-CGmem-PoreLocalization
The repository contains the codes used for finding the location of pores formed by electric field in coarse-grained Martini membranes. 
Seperate codes are used for analysing the average plasma membrane (APM) composition and the brain plasma membrane (BPM) compositon. The results are being prepared for publication. 

The codes have been developed by Xinru Tang and Fangwei Zhao.
