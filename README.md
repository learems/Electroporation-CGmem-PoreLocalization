# Electroporation-CGmem-PoreLocalization
The repository contains the codes used for finding the location of pores formed by electric field in coarse-grained Martini membranes. 
Seperate codes are used for analysing the average plasma membrane (APM) composition and the brain plasma membrane (BPM) compositon. The results are published at [eLife](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.74773). 

The codes have been developed by Xinru Tang and Fangwei Zhao.
